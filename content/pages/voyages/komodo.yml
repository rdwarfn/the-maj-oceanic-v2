    Manta rays, sea turtles and bottle nose dolphins are just three of more than 1000 species of marine animals that call Komodo National Park home. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the park stretches a total area of 1,733 square kilometers, encompassing three main islands—Komodo, Padar, and Rinca—and 26 smaller islets.

    Chartering a boat in Komodo easily solves the challenge of moving between islands and finding accommodation, so you get to enjoy the incredible attractions of the region both above and below the waves.

    Komodo is the common term used for a primarily volcanic chain of islands in the south east of Indonesia. In fact, this is more accurately made up of three main islands: Komodo Island, Rinca Island, and Padar Island that together with a few other islets form over 2,000 square kilometers of protected national parkland.<br/><br/>Dragons and diving are the two main reasons people decide to charter a liveaboard in Komodo. The infamous Komodo dragon, the biggest reptile on earth which can reach weights of up to 70 kilograms and grow up to 3 meters in length roams freely across the region.

    Whether you enjoy scuba diving or snorkelling, exploring the nautical delights of the region is a must. Plankton rich waters and rushing currents attract giant pelagics, sharks, turtles, and manta rays while hundreds of varieties of coral thrive providing homes for an impressive array of macro life. The best time to cruise Komodo is between May and October.
