  - heading: The ‘great nutmeg island’
    description: >
      The volcanic Banda Islands are as rich in history and natural beauty as they are remote. Centuries ago, this tiny archipelago in Maluku was the world’s only source of nutmeg, the ‘gold of the spice trade.’ Today, only adventurous travellers make the trip—and are rewarded with bygone colonial architecture, buzzing spice markets, and postcard-pretty scenery.
