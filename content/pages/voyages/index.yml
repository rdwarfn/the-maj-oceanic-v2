    description: >
      The volcanic Banda Islands are as rich in history and natural beauty as
      they are remote. Centuries ago, this tiny archipelago in Maluku was the
      worldâ€™s only source of nutmeg, the â€˜gold of the spice trade.â€™ Today, only
      adventurous travellers make the tripâ€”and are rewarded with bygone colonial
      architecture, buzzing spice markets, and postcard-pretty scenery.
