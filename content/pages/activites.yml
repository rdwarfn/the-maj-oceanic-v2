    Snorkel in some of the densest and most diverse marine habitats in the world. Kayak and paddle into the sunset. Ride your jet-ski aimlessly and then stop by a remote, pristine beach to take a breather by simply watching the time go by.

    Unwind and take the stress away without having to leave the boat. Relax with locally-inspired spa treatments. Practice yoga to the soothing sound of ocean waves. Experience the one-of-a-kind equatorial golf on the top deck of the ship, with the ocean as your fairway. The game's special biodegradable balls contain fish food, improving marine sustainability and biodiversity.

      Moody sunset hikes to the top of Padar Island, I’ve been up here many times & it was crazy to see it so quiet 😯 over the coming months we plan to see more of Indonesia & support local tourism as much as we can 🙏🏼
