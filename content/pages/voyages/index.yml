    heading: The ‘great nutmeg island’
    description: >
      The volcanic Banda Islands are as rich in history and natural beauty as
      they are remote. Centuries ago, this tiny archipelago in Maluku was the
      world’s only source of nutmeg, the ‘gold of the spice trade.’ Today, only
      adventurous travellers make the trip—and are rewarded with bygone colonial
      architecture, buzzing spice markets, and postcard-pretty scenery.
