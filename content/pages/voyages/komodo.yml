    Manta rays, sea turtles and bottle nose dolphins are just three of more than 1000 species of marine animals that call Komodo National Park home. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the park stretches a total area of 1,733 square kilometers, encompassing three main islands—Komodo, Padar, and Rinca—and 26 smaller islets.
